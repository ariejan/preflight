# Preflight

Preflight helps you setup a new macos or ubuntu workstation. This repo is highly 
opionated, so feel free to fork it and make it your own.

## macos

bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ariejan/preflight/master/bin/setup)
```

This will first ask to install **Command Line Tools** in order to install `git`. 
Once CLT are installed, re-run the bash-curl command.
